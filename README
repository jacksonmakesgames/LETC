To create Visual Studio Solution, run "cmake .." from the "build" folder

For Emscripten, 
    activate the Emscripten env                                 (On windows, launch emcmdpromp.bat)
    navigate to embuild                                         (Watty/embuild)
    emcmake cmake -DEMSCRIPTEN=TRUE -G "Unix Makefiles" ..      (Generates Makefiles and configures them for Emscripten)
    make                                                        (Compiles *.c* -> LLVM Bitcode -> Javascript and then links)

    NOTE: if emcmake doesn't work, try running test.bat/test.py in dependencies/emscripten. Also check everything is on PATH

Note that Box2D requires a different javascript version, so we have to link against dependencies/box2d.js
